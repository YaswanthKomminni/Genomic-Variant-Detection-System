# Genomic-Variant-Detection-System
Implemented a Python-based solution to detect genomic variants by comparing sample DNA sequences with a reference sequence. The project identifies mismatches and mutation positions using string processing and algorithmic logic, demonstrating efficient data handling, condition-based analysis, and bioinformatics fundamentals.
